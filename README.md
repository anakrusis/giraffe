# Graphics Interface Routines Across Frameworks For Everyone

The GIRAFFE library will be pieced together from various GUI routines that have been scattered around my projects of the last two years.
In the "ancient versions" folder is said code; each version will be compared against one another to create unified versions for each of the frameworks. 
Each framework's version will be maintained in parallel, and be as close in implementation and structure as possible.
